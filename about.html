                <p class="heading"> My name is Tássia and I'm a junior front-end developer based in Lisbon.</p>
    
                <p>My first experience with coding was when I was a teenager and coded and designed my blog templates.
                <br>
                But it was only some years later that I thought that I could do it as a profession. I had just sold my store, a
                shoes and accessories franchise, and was going to move to another country, Portugal. It was the perfect moment
                to try something new. 
                <br>
                Already in Lisbon, I took a 5-month front-end development course at Edit. and I completely 
                fell in love with it and its possibilities.
                
                </p>

                <p>I am passionate about learning and building pretty and easy to use projects.
                </p>
    
                <p> 
                    In my spare time, you can find me snuggling with my cats 
                    <em>(they came with me from Brazil)</em>, 
                     watching series <em>(I'll probably have something to recommend)</em>, 
                     taking photos or
                     planning my next trip.
                    
                </p>
